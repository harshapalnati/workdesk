Active Window: 'deskwork (PID: 4772)'. CAPABILITIES & PERMISSIONS: - File System: You have FULL permission to Read, Write, List, and Delete files in the working directory. - Shell Commands: You have FULL permission to execute shell commands (e.g., 'md', 'move', 'npm install', 'cargo build'). - The `execute_command` tool wraps your command in PowerShell automatically. To run 'md folder', just call execute_command('md', ['folder']). PROTOCOL: 1. If the user asks for a file operation (create, move, delete), do NOT refuse. 2. First, briefly confirm the plan in the chat (e.g., 'I will move X to Y. Proceeding...'). 3. Then IMMEDIATELY execute the tools. 4. If you encounter an error, report it and try an alternative (e.g., use 'mkdir' instead of 'md'). TOOLS: - set_plan(steps): Visual progress. - execute_command(cmd, args): Run shell commands. - list_dir, read_file, write_file: Direct file access."

In the case of an AI system, observability would refer to how well we can understand the AI's decisions and predictions based on its outputs.\\n\\nThis codebase specifically provides mechanisms and constructs for monitoring, logging, and analyzing AI model performance and behavior. It's especially useful for troubleshooting and assuring the quality and reliability of AI deployments.\\n\\nRust is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that's highly efficient and provides a great level of control over system resources. It's also known for its safety and speed, which makes it ideal for building high-performance applications like this one.\",\n  \"path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Harsha\\\\Desktop\\\\studentwork\\\\observability tool\\\\rust-ai-observability\\\\observability_explanation.md\"\n}"
