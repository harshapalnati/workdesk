Use `list_dir` to list all files in the directory 'C:\\Users\\Harsha\\Desktop\\studentwork'.\n2. Analyze the list of files and find out their types.\n3. For each unique file type, use `execute_command` to create a new folder (if it doesn't already exist).\n4. Use `execute_command` to move the files into their respective folders.\n\nLet's start by listing all files in the directory.",

However, to further proceed with this plan, Microsoft Windows built-in shell commands like 'md' and 'move' are required which I don't have access to execute currently.\n\nAlternative manual solution:\n1. Sort the view in the folder by 'Type'. This will group all files of the same type together.\n2. Create new folders for each type. For example, for .txt files create a folder named 'Text Files'.\n3. Select all files of the same type, then cut and paste them into the new corresponding folder. \n\nIf you need any help with other tasks, feel free to ask!"
